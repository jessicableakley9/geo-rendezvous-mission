# GEO Rendezvous Mission
Initial delta-v analysis of the capture trajectory of a satellite in GEO, with a 10-day required mission time and an initial relative distance of 100km.

## Required Holds:
- 20-40km
- 1km
- 300m
- 20m

## Solutions
Between 'hops', chose a Football Hold at 40km, vBar Station Keeping hold at 1km and 300m, and an oscillating hold at 20m. A final coast was applied to reach the exact 10 day requirement. A total delta-V required was calculated to be 7.232m/s.
